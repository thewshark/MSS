To update your BackOffice you just need to unzip the content from the ZIP file inside your MSS installation.

Important Notes:

-> Make sure that the version on the ZIP is the same you have installed.

-> Allways backup all the files inside you actual folder before updating.

-> Comfirm if your ERP version is compatible with the current BackOffice version.
